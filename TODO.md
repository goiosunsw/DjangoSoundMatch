# TODO: 

## 21/1/2016:

- Fix the use of soundadjustpage to be able to adjust for different parameters
- add sound samples to instruction pages

## 15/1/2016: 

> I was trying to use the same model for all the pages, an experiment would in fact correspond to an instruction page, a demo page, etc. but they need quite different models.

> Is there a way to establish a sequence of models/views that is not hard-coded? 

Fixed using generic models
